Wheel Of Fortune Sound Player

This is a small, standalone MFC app that runs on Windows.  It plays some common Wheel of Fortune sound effects for use
with a Wheel of Fortune game.

Note: This was created for use at our local high school for the senior party Wheel of Fortune room.  We have a large
wheel, and the kids come in and play to win prizes.  The sound effects add to the ambience of the room.

This small app was built in Microsoft DevStudio 2012, and compiles and runs on any windows platform.

It does, however, require that Windows Media Player 9.0 or higher be installed, as it leverages that as an ActiveX control
in the interface.

Enjoy!

Fork and improve, if you are so inclined.
